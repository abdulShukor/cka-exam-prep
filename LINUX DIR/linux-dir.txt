** Linux Dir ** 

In Linux/Unix operating system everything is a file even directories are files, files are files, and devices like mouse, keyboard, printer, etc are also files. Here we are going to see the Directory Structure in Linux.

Types of files in the Linux system:

1. General Files – It is also called ordinary files. It may be an image, video, program, or simple text file. These types of files can be in ASCII or Binary format. It is the most commonly used file in the Linux system.

2. Directory Files – These types of files are a warehouse for other file types. It may be a directory file within a directory (subdirectory).

3. Device Files – In a Windows-like operating system, devices like CD-ROM, and hard drives are represented as drive letters like F: G: H whereas in the Linux system devices are represented as files. As for example, /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, and so on.

We know that in a Windows-like operating system, files are stored in different folders on different data drives like C: D: E: whereas in the Linux/Unix operating system files are stored in a tree-like structure starting with the root directory as shown in the below diagram. 

/bin (Binary): Contains essential binary executables (programs) that are required for the system's basic operations. These binaries are available to all users.

/boot: Contains files needed for the system's boot process, such as the kernel, initial RAM disk (initramfs), and bootloader configuration.

/dev (Device): Contains device files that represent physical and virtual devices, such as hard drives, terminals, and random number generators.

/etc (Etcetera): Houses system-wide configuration files and shell scripts that are used to initialize or configure various applications.

/home: User home directories are located here. Each user typically has a subdirectory within /home where they can store personal files and configuration settings.

/lib (Library): Contains shared library files that are essential for the system and programs to function properly.

/media: Mount point for removable media devices, such as USB drives and external hard disks.

/opt (Optional): Used for installing optional software packages. Some third-party applications may be installed in this directory.

/proc (Process): A virtual filesystem that provides information about system processes and kernel parameters.

/sbin (System Binary): Contains essential system binaries that are typically used by the system administrator for system maintenance and recovery.

/tmp (Temporary): A directory for temporary files. Files in this directory are often deleted when the system reboots.

/usr (Unix System Resources): Contains user binaries, libraries, documentation, and other resources. It is usually mounted read-only and shared among multiple systems.

/var (Variable): Contains variable data, such as logs, spool files, and temporary files generated by system processes.
