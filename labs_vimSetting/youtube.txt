Notes:
PVC and pod should be in same namespace. PV is cluster based 

Try avoid placing pod on control plane 

Imperative in exam. Declarative way in organizational 
Config issue mostly the server url or the control plan port with config file 
Compare the default config with given that have problem or error 

ReplicaSet acquire the existing pod running in cluster with same labels, stand alone pods become part of rs, if delete the stand alone then rs will create a new
K get pods --show-lables for creating the rs label to acquire the already one 

Selector
 Mmtchlabels 
  Label // to register pod as property of deployment or rs 

K get pods -A -o json --sort-by=.metadata.timecreated /this is descending order 
K get pods -A -o json --sort-by=.metadata.timecreated | tac // this is ascending order

Echo "K get pods -A -o json --sort-by=.metadata.timecreated | tac "  > /opt/pods.asc.sh
Chmod +x /opt/pods.asc.sh //permission to execute 

-rwxr-xr-x means that the file owner has read, write, and execute permissions, the group has read and execute permissions, and others have read and execute permissions. 
1. Owner of the file
2. Group the file belong to
3. other neither above two 

To execute:
/opt/pods.asc.sh
bash /opt/pods.asc.sh 

Not need .item for custom command 

Default is descending order when retrieving k8 objects

Args when want to run only commands Question-37

command: ["git", "clone", "https://github.com/username/repository.git", "/path/to/save/repository"]

Check the typo of deployment by comparing with imperative command to generate deployment 


Exec -it bash or sh (inside pod]
exec -- curl (connect/attach to pod)/

Etcd -version 
If <data-dir-location> is the same folder as before, delete it and stop etcd process before restoring the cluster. Else change etcd configuration and restart the etcd process after restoration to make it use the new data directory.

Ps -aux | grep kubelet
Cat /path | grep static pod
